Isabel met an enormous bear,   
Isabel, Isabel, didn't care;   
The bear was hungry, the bear was ravenous,    
The bear's big mouth was cruel and cavernous.    
The bear said, Isabel, glad to meet you,     
How do, Isabel, now I'll eat you!     
Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry.     
Isabel didn't scream or scurry.
